# 🎵 Audio to Image Converter - GenAI Project

## 🌟 Project Overview

The **Audio to Image Converter** is a **Generative AI (GenAI)** project that takes an **audio file** as input and generates a **visual representation (image)** inspired by the content, mood, and characteristics of the audio file. This project leverages **Stability AI's image generation models (like Stable Diffusion)** to create AI-generated images based on audio analysis.

The frontend is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while **Stability AI APIs** handle the backend image generation part.

## 📽️ How It Works

1. **Upload Audio File:** Users can upload an MP3, WAV, or other supported audio formats.
2. **Audio Processing:** The system extracts features such as:
   - Tempo
   - Pitch
   - Sentiment (Happy, Sad, Calm, etc.)
   - Keywords or themes (if available from audio metadata or speech-to-text conversion).
3. **Prompt Generation:** Based on the extracted audio features, a **text prompt** is dynamically generated.
4. **Stability AI Integration:** The generated prompt is sent to **Stability AI's Stable Diffusion API**, which returns a unique image.
5. **Display:** The generated image is displayed to the user.
